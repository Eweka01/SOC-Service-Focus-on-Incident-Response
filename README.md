## Overview

This paper examines Incident Response (IR) as a vital service area within a Security Operations Center (SOC). It discusses how integrating Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can enhance the maturity of IR capabilities and outlines objectives, dependencies, requirements, and steps to advance maturity using a Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The ultimate goal is to develop a highly mature, intelligence-driven incident response capability that protects organizational assets and ensures business continuity in the face of evolving cyber threats.

## Key Sections

### 1. Introduction
Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are central to an organization's ability to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats. This paper highlights the critical role of Incident Response (IR) and how Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) integration can bolster SOC capabilities.

### 2. Objectives and Expected Outcomes
The primary objective of Incident Response is to minimize the impact of security incidents on organizational assets and operations. The expected outcomes include timely detection, effective analysis, minimal disruption to business operations, and continuous improvement of IR capabilities. Success is measured by reduced incident response times, effective containment, and post-incident improvements.

### 3. Dependencies
- **People**: Skilled incident responders, security analysts, and strong management support are crucial to effective IR.
- **Processes**: Well-defined processes, including incident classification, escalation paths, and communication protocols, guide response efforts.
- **Technology**: Tools such as SIEM systems, EDR tools, and threat intelligence feeds are essential for detecting, analyzing, and managing incidents.

### 4. Requirements for Providing Incident Response Services
Effective IR services require a combination of skilled personnel, comprehensive processes, and advanced technologies. A well-trained team, robust procedures for each phase of incident response, and integration of security tools are essential for maintaining an effective IR capability.

### 5. Maturity Levels
- **Level 1**: Organizations initiating IR services should focus on assembling a team, acquiring essential tools, and developing foundational processes.
- **Level 2 to Level 3**: Enhancing existing services involves streamlining processes, automating routine tasks, and fostering collaboration with external partners to handle complex incidents.

### 6. Conclusion
Incident Response within a SOC is crucial for safeguarding organizational assets and ensuring business continuity. Continuous improvement, driven by lessons learned from past incidents, helps maintain a resilient SOC that can effectively respond to emerging threats.
